var intman_abst = "  Intersection management is a widely studied problem. We consider the case of an unsignalized intersection being used only by autonomus vehicles. We periodically assign an intersection utilization sequence called 'schedule' to the randomly arriving vehicles and we also consider optimizing the trajectories of all the vehicles to minimize their discomfort and the time spent within the intersection. We propose two methods to perform the actions of scheduling and trajectory optimization. In first method, given a schedule, we completely optimize the trajectory of all the vehicles being scheduled simultaneously. In the second method, we determine the schedule by assigning weights to each vehicle based on certain parameters and then optimizing their trajectories in a sequential manner. A micro-simulation test bed using Python and CasADi was created. The following movie is a vizualization of one of those  simulations. "; 

var kura_abst = " In the video seen below, we have implemented the algorithm developed in "Balanced Deployment of Multiple Robots Using a Modified Kuramoto Model" by Z. Xu, et. al. on ground robots. The robots, which are initially distributed random ly on a circle, separate themselves at equal arc lengths from their immediate neighbours and converge to a desired angular velocity. The robots used in the experiments are m3pi robots manufactured by Pololu. To accurately determine the position of each robot, a motion capture system using Optitrack cameras were used. The control signals are transmitted to the robots using Xbee S1 modules.";
