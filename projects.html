	<p>1. <u>Scheduling and Optimal contol of Autonomous Vehicles at Unsignalized Intersections</u></p>
	<p id = "abs">	</p>
	
	<button type="reset" onclick='document.getElementById("abs").innerHTML = "  Intersection management is a widely studied problem. We consider the case of an unsignalized intersection being used only by autonomous vehicles. We periodically assign an intersection utilization sequence called &#39schedule&#39 to the randomly arriving vehicles. We also consider optimizing the trajectories of all the vehicles to minimize their discomfort and the time it takes to cross the intersection. We propose two methods to perform the actions of scheduling and trajectory optimization. In the first method, we simultaneously assign a schedule and optimize the trajectory of all the vehicles that arrive in the system. In the second method, we determine the schedule by assigning weights to each vehicle based on certain parameters and then optimize their trajectories in a sequential manner. The two proposed algorithms were simulated using Python and CasADi. The following movie is a vizualization of one of those simulations. " '>Show abstract</button>

		<p>2. <u>Modified Kuramoto Oscillator for ground robots</u></p>
	
	<p id = "kurabs">	</p>
<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("kurabs").innerHTML = " In the video seen below, we have implemented the algorithm developed in [1] on ground robots. The robots, which are initially distributed randomly on a circle, separate themselves at equal arc lengths from their immediate neighbours and converge to a desired angular velocity. The robots used in the experiments are m3pi robots manufactured by Pololu. To accurately determine the position of each robot, a motion capture system using Optitrack cameras was used. The control signals are transmitted to the robots using Xbee S1 modules. "'>Show abstract</button>
