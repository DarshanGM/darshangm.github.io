We decompose the trajectory of each vehicle into two phases: the provisional phase and the coordinated phase. A vehicle, upon entering the region of interest, initially operates in the provisional phase, in which the vehicle is allowed to optimize its trajectory but is constrained to guarantee in-lane safety and to not enter the intersection. Periodically, all the vehicles in their provisional phase switch to their coordinated phase, which is obtained by coordinated optimization of the schedule of the vehicles&rsquo; intersection usage as well as their trajectories. For the coordinated phase, we propose a data-driven solution, in which the intersection usage order is obtained through a data-driven online &ldquo;classification&rdquo;	 and the trajectories are computed sequentially. This approach is computationally very efficient and does not compromise much on optimality. Moreover, it also allows for incorporation of &ldquo;macro&rdquo; information such as traffic arrival rates into the solution. We also discuss a distributed implementation of this proposed data-driven sequential algorithm. Finally, we compare the proposed algorithm and its two variants against traditional methods of intersection management and against some existing results in the literature by micro-simulations.

The robots, which are initially distributed randomly on a circle, separate themselves at equal arc lengths from their immediate neighbours and converge to a desired angular velocity. The robots used in the experiments are m3pi robots manufactured by Pololu. To accurately determine the position of each robot, a motion capture system using Optitrack cameras was used. The control signals are transmitted to the robots using Xbee S1 modules. <br/> <strong><u> References </u> </	strong> <br/> [1] Xu, Z., Egerstedt, M., Droge, G. and Schilling, K., 2013, June.
